# Weatherbot

Hyperlocal weather forecasts from Alexa! Weatherbot gives you up-to-the-minute weather information for your exact location.

You can ask for things like the current forecast, today's forecast, this week's forecast, temperature, high, low, precipitation, wind, humidity, dew point, UV index, visibility, and weather alerts. You can ask for these things for a specific date, time, or location.
